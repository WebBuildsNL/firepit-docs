Slugs in the Firepit CMS are smart. They are stored inside the `slugs` table and there's an additional `slug_redirects`
table to handle redirects.

## Retrieving a model

The most basic way to retrieve a model based on a slug:

```php
Page::findBySlug('my-slug');
```

However, sometimes when a slug isn't found you want to return a 404:

```php
Page::findBySlugOrFail('my-slug');
```

Additionally, you can also extend this to support slugs that have changed and redirect to it:

```php
Page::findBySlugOrRedirectOrFail('my-slug');
```
