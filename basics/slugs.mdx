# Slugs in Firepit CMS

Slugs are an essential component of the Firepit CMS for creating SEO-friendly URLs for your content. This document covers how slugs are implemented, their features, and how to use them effectively in your Firepit CMS project.

## Overview

A slug is a URL-friendly version of a string, typically generated from a page title or other identifiable text. Slugs are used to create human-readable and search engine optimized URLs.

Example:
- Page title: "How to Get Started with Firepit CMS"
- Generated slug: "how-to-get-started-with-firepit-cms"
- Resulting URL: `https://yoursite.com/how-to-get-started-with-firepit-cms`

## Key Features

- **Automatic Generation**: Slugs are automatically created and updated based on model attributes
- **Uniqueness**: System ensures all slugs are unique by appending numbers when needed
- **Locale Awareness**: Slugs are stored with the current application locale
- **History and Redirects**: Maintains a history of previous slugs to handle redirects
- **SEO Protection**: Automatic 301 redirects from old slugs to new ones
- **Date-based Slugs**: Optional date inclusion in slug structure
- **Customizable**: Configurable source fields and formatting options

## Implementation

Firepit CMS implements slug functionality through a trait-based approach with dedicated models and database tables:

### Core Components

1. **Sluggable Trait**: The heart of the slug system that can be applied to any model
2. **Slug Model**: Stores current slugs and their associations with content
3. **SlugRedirect Model**: Maintains old slugs for redirection
4. **DynamicRouter**: Handles routing requests to the correct content based on slugs

### Database Structure

Two primary tables handle slug functionality:

- **slugs**: Stores current active slugs with polymorphic relationships to content
- **slug_redirects**: Maintains a history of old slugs for redirection purposes

## Using Slugs in Models

### Adding Slug Support to Models

To make your model support slugs, simply use the `Sluggable` trait:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Firepit\CMS\Traits\Sluggable;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class MyContent extends Model
{
    use Sluggable;

    // By default, slugs are generated from the 'title' attribute
    // Override if needed:

    protected function getSlugSourceAttribute()
    {
        return $this->headline; // Use a different field as source
    }
}
```

### Customizing Slug Generation

You can customize various aspects of slug generation:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Firepit\CMS\Traits\Sluggable;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Article extends Model
{
    use Sluggable;

    // Use multiple fields in slug generation
    protected function getSlugSourceAttribute()
    {
        return $this->category . ' ' . $this->title;
    }

    // Include date in slugs
    public function usesDateBasedSlugs(): bool
    {
        return true;
    }

    // Customize date format for slugs
    public function getSlugDateFormat(): string
    {
        return 'Y/m'; // Creates slugs like: 2025/04/my-article-title
    }
}
```

## Accessing and Using Slugs

### Getting the Current Slug

```php
$article = Article::find(1);
$slug = $article->getSlug(); // Returns the current slug string
$path = $article->getPath(); // Returns the full path including any date components
```

### Finding Models by Slug

```php
// Find a model by its slug
$article = Article::findBySlug('my-article-title');

// Find with exception if not found
$article = Article::findBySlugOrFail('my-article-title');

// Find with redirect handling - important for handling old URLs
$article = Article::findBySlugOrRedirectOrFail('my-article-title');
```

## Locale Handling

Slugs in Firepit CMS are locale-aware and use the current application locale:

```php
// Current app locale is 'en'
$article->title = 'My English Title';
$article->save();
// Creates slug: 'my-english-title' with locale 'en'

// Switch locale
app()->setLocale('fr');
$article->title = 'Mon Titre FranÃ§ais';
$article->save();
// Creates slug: 'mon-titre-francais' with locale 'fr'

// Get slug for current locale
$slug = $article->getSlug(); // Returns slug for current app locale
```

The system automatically tracks which locale each slug belongs to, allowing you to have different URLs for different language versions of your content.

## Slug Redirects

When a slug changes (for example, when a page title is edited), Firepit CMS:

1. Creates a new slug for the current title
2. Moves the old slug to the `slug_redirects` table
3. Automatically sets up 301 redirects from old URLs to new ones

This redirection happens transparently to maintain SEO rankings and prevent broken links.

## Understanding findBySlugOrRedirectOrFail

The `findBySlugOrRedirectOrFail` method is a powerful tool for handling both current and historical slugs:

```php
// Try to find a page by slug, with redirect handling
$page = Page::findBySlugOrRedirectOrFail($slug, ['*'], '/fallback-url');
```

When this method is called:

1. It first attempts to find the model using the current slug
2. If found, it returns the model immediately
3. If not found, it checks the `slug_redirects` table for any historical matches
4. If a redirect is found:
- It generates a new URL by replacing the old slug with the current one
- Performs a 301 redirect to the new URL
5. If no redirect is found:
- It redirects to the fallback URL if provided
- Otherwise, it aborts with a 404 error

This method is essential for maintaining SEO value when content URLs change.

## Dynamic Routing

The Firepit CMS `DynamicRouter` handles routing to content based on slugs:

1. Intercepts requests that don't match explicit routes
2. Looks up the slug in the database
3. Redirects to the new URL if the slug has changed
4. Loads and renders the appropriate content if the slug is current

For performance, the router caches page slugs to minimize database queries.

## Best Practices

- **Keep Titles Descriptive**: Since slugs are generated from titles, ensure your titles are descriptive and relevant
- **Avoid Changing Slugs for Established Content**: While redirects will handle changes, it's best to keep URLs stable for important pages
- **Use Custom Slugs Sparingly**: The automatic system works well for most cases, but you can manually set slugs when needed
- **Consider URL Structure**: Use date-based slugs for chronological content like blog posts
- **Use findBySlugOrRedirectOrFail**: For front-end routes, always use this method to ensure proper handling of redirects

## Technical Notes

- Slug generation removes special characters, converts spaces to hyphens, and ensures URL compatibility
- The system handles conflict resolution with incrementing numbers (e.g., "my-title", "my-title-1", "my-title-2")
- Slugs are stored in lowercase to avoid case-sensitivity issues in URLs
- Database indexes optimize slug lookups for performance
- Each slug is associated with the application locale at the time of creation
