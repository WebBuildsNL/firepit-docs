You can easily create new pages through the admin panel.

## Setup the dynamic router
You can easily configure the dynamic router. The router uses a fallback route so it's important to add the CMS routes at
the very end of your routes file. The Firepit CMS has a very simple helper method for registering the routes.

```php
<?php

// Any existing hard coded routes
Route::view('/', 'welcome');

// Register CMS routes by adding this at the very bottom of the file
cms()->routes();

```

## Creating blocks
We use Paver Editor. See [https://pavereditor.com/docs/beta/making-blocks](https://pavereditor.com/docs/beta/making-blocks).

## Register blocks
```php
cms()->registerBlock(Hero::class);
```

## Rendering pages
### Rendering all page content
```blade
<x-cms::page :$page />
```

### Rendering only rich editor content
```blade
<x-cms::page.content :$page />
```

### Rendering only blocks
```blade
<x-cms::page.blocks :$blocks />
```
